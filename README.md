# Source Code Tools

A collection of useful command line development tools for source code maintenance written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  I use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) as the IDE for maintaining the tools.

- __Ender__ reports on and fixing line endings
- __Vamper__ updates file and product version numbers across a variety of different file types
- __Spacer__ fixes spaces and tabs in source code and other text files

## Installation

The latest version of the tools can be installed using [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh) with:

    brew install https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlyonsmith/288321e7dec8520761c2/raw/45b0b2a9c21fa088c8d6f375b37f11cf28bd923c/codetools.rb
